# Real-time closed loop phase detection

Here, I re-implemented closed-loop phase detection software from inside open-ephys modules to work within the SpikeGadgets open-source electrophysiology recording environment. This software detects 4 possible phases of arbitrary band-pass and triggers a laser.

A mirror of this code with accompanying trodes software can be found here, in the PhaseDisrupt feature branch:
